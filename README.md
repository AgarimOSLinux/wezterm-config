This is my WIP Wezterm configuration.

I use Pragmasevka as primary font. You can download it here:

As fallback font I use "icomoon-feather" font. You can download it here:

If you wonder why  my font size is 18, is just because of my setup:

I created this configuration to explain in my YouTube Channel how to configure WezTerm.

My YouTube Channel is intended for Spanish speakers, but I also answer questions in English or German.
